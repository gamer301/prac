 I am a professional day trader my name
 is cotton candy ta I'll take the profits
 there it's like 8 000 profits well we're
 coming up to our Target what did I make
 on that trade 550 it's not bad at all
 actually I've been doing it for over a
 decade and I've made a comprehensive
 guide that's going to take you from Zero
 to Hero or from making nothing in day
 trading to making millions of dollars a
 year I have pretty much uncovered every
 single corner of this industry and I
 wanted to make a complete guide that
 would cover absolutely every corner no
 stone left unturned so if you make it
 from the very beginning of this video to
 the end you're gonna have a direct path
 to have a lifelong career in day trading
 and be quite successful doing it now
 it's not going to be easy I'm going to
 warn you I've got a ton of work that I'm
 gonna have to go with you over the next
 hour and we've got a ton of stuff to do
 I'm taking every single thing I know
 about day trading jamming it into one
 guide so that if you can sit here for an
 hour you're gonna be on your way to
 being a professional day trader so enjoy
 and uh good luck
 [Music]
 okay so there's gonna be six chapters
 that we go through different things and
 I'm going to list them off for you right
 now so that if you want to skip to a
 section in this guide I'm sure people
 are going to watch it many times this
 will kind of be like your glossary or an
 anchor point to say okay this is what
 chapter one was all about two three four
 five and six and then you can use the
 bookmarks and thumbnails and all that
 stuff too uh Just Surf through the
 chapters so in the first chapter we're
 going to talk about how and why to use
 community in the second chapter we're
 going to talk about how to learn ta and
 where to learn your technical analysis
 in the third chapter we're going to talk
 about exchanges and Brokers and what to
 use and where to trade in the fourth
 chapter we're going to talk about an
 example of what day trading looks like
 day to day so what your life ideally
 should look like to help people kind of
 guide them in scheduling and stuff like
 that in the fifth chapter we're going to
 talk about mental analysis and how to
 kind of keep your cool and keep your
 mind all wrapped up nicely and tight so
 that you have the best performance and
 in the sixth chapter we're going to talk
 about just living life as a day trader
 and kind of what the career looks like
 so long term and you know you're sitting
 here deciding should I become a day
 trader become a day trader well this is
 going to show you what the life actually
 looks like from a realistic standpoint
 not the fancy cars and
 private airplanes and all that junk so
 let's get right into it in uh chapter
 one so use that as your glossary going
 forward yeah let's jump straight to
 chapter one
 okay so chapter one how and why to use
 community so this chapter is all focused
 on community and the benefits of a
 community so before you kind of start
 your career in day trading you want to
 or even starting to learn about it you
 kind of want to immerse yourself into a
 Community First you want to ideally be
 around like-minded people just like if
 you were in University you kind of want
 to be around
 um other like-minded students who are
 learning at the same Pace like just if
 you went into University one and you're
 around a bunch of people who have no
 clue what they're doing and everybody's
 like oh damn like I just
 got here this day one class and you just
 kind of want to make a few friends just
 so you have someone to bounce ideas off
 of and just to kind of feel at home to
 kind of identify with the culture in the
 world so you know surrounding yourself
 with Community is is really important
 now
 um another benefit to community is that
 you want to be around other more
 influential and more experienced Traders
 so that when you do have questions come
 up say for example you're in class
 something is way over your head you're
 not understanding you have other people
 to ask to say hey I didn't really get
 this can you help clarify it for me you
 get a lot of that in day trading the
 learning path is pretty big so before
 you start learning you just kind of want
 to evolve yourself in uh in a community
 and just be around people where you can
 say hey my name is Sam or whatever your
 name is or your screen name
 light post Bobby or you know whatever
 your screen name is you want you want to
 just be around people and introduce
 yourself and have those resources
 available to you so when you get stuck
 you're not facing it alone because when
 you face it alone in day trading it
 costs you money if there's a problem
 that you don't know the answer to and
 you're just guessing well those guesses
 they cost you money so we want to kind
 of eliminate as much of that as possible
 we want to minimize the amount of
 guesswork that you have to do so you
 want to be surrounded by community
 members who are on the same path as you
 and other people who can also help
 Mentor you
 so with that said I would recommend
 joining my Discord Community
 um
 I don't know too much about the other
 communities in the day trading space but
 what I do know is that if you're
 learning how to day trade you kind of
 want to be around people who are
 learning the same material as you you
 wouldn't want to be getting Guided by
 community members who may be learning
 something completely different that
 would be the equivalent of being a
 student in dentist school or in law
 school and asking a mechanic how to fill
 a tooth or how to file an injunction if
 you're a lawyer I just doesn't really
 make sense to kind of mix those barriers
 you're going to get the wrong
 information it's just going to be a big
 mess so when you're when you're learning
 you kind of have to pin them hand in
 hand like where do you want to learn
 join that Community the worst thing you
 can do is where do you want to learn and
 then be a part of like 10 or 15
 communities because again it would be
 like being in dentist school and
 starting to ask
 um
 people who are in architecture school
 may be to do a filling and then asking
 somebody who's in biochemical Sciences
 how to do a crown molding like it just
 doesn't make sense right so you want to
 be around like-minded people
 for that reason I would suggest using my
 community I'll leave the Discord link on
 the screen here and not only on the
 screen here but it'll also be in the
 comment section it's free to join he
 just joined the community and you're
 going to be around like-minded people
 who will also be able to help and Mentor
 you so that's a really important thing
 evolve yourself in community just
 immerse yourself into it jump in the
 Discord say hello to people read the
 rules be like hey my name is X this is
 where I'm at here's where I'm day
 trading you're going to link up with
 other people who are like-minded friends
 and you're all going to be able to help
 each other push faster because at the
 end of this the goal is to make people
 better day Traders quicker and to have
 them have more success in shorter
 periods of time so that's going to be
 like my number one recommendation for
 Community just join my Discord we have
 thousands and thousands of members and
 again it's just all for you just click a
 few buttons bang you're you're done
 you're just you're you're immersed
 you're chatting
 say love you you're done so that that's
 the first thing Community wise and then
 what I will do
 is I'm gonna say like now that you're in
 the community so that takes care of why
 you want to join a community and what
 community to join this is going to be
 the best experience you can now get
 inside of the community and how you
 should kind of manage yourself and um
 how you should kind of say like okay
 what can I do to maximize this what can
 I do to get the most returns out of it
 I'm in a community how can I vampire
 suck everything I can out of it right so
 that's kind of how you want to look at
 it so what you want to do now is you
 want to say hey my name is X this is
 what I'm learning I'm here is there
 anybody else who's kind of at the same
 place look at all the different channels
 like we have channels for
 um you know crypto we have channels for
 stocks we just have open Channel talk
 about your experiences say hey I'm on uh
 lesson three this is what I'm learning
 it's super cool even just the action of
 typing out what you're learning is
 helping embed it into your mind so when
 I Mentor people and I have coaches who
 Mentor people and I've been doing this
 for like 12 13 years now my coaches who
 I train they learn the most and have the
 biggest leaps in performance and
 progress when they start teaching others
 now it's not the fact that they're
 teaching them it's just the fact that
 they're repeating the same things over
 and over so like it'll become a really
 good thing when you can kind of just
 open dialogue about what you're on if
 you're on lesson three and it's say for
 example I don't know or whatever lesson
 you're on it's about hold levels for
 example you should type out in chat hey
 guys I'm on hold levels I thought it was
 really cool that when price comes to a
 whole level there is also smaller time
 frame hold levels underneath it that can
 also support the move so like which one
 should I go after or even if you don't
 even have to say which one you don't
 even have to answer with a question you
 can just type about it talk about it and
 it's going to help it ingrain into your
 mind and then you're going to open up
 dialogue to other people so you kind of
 want to have this constant revolving
 dialogue around the things you're doing
 all the time this makes it as much like
 a university level experience as
 possible because those are your
 classmates and by just talking about it
 having these revolving conversations do
 that with every single lesson just
 create this wealth of of knowledge for
 yourself where you're just constant talk
 about it so that's how I would use a
 community and then if you want to unlock
 more Community stuff I have a patreon
 page and there's like more advanced
 levels and stuff like that if you want
 to become into mentorship or into
 coaches and and you know call out groups
 and stuff like that you can get into
 that that's you know for you to produce
 on your own time I'll leave the patreon
 link here if you want to join it but you
 don't need to by all means you can just
 join the free side of Discord and then
 there's a paid side it doesn't matter as
 long as you're just in and around
 community members
 um I have people who have been there for
 like five years I've been a free member
 for all five years I have people who
 have joined on month one and they want
 to take the most highest advanced level
 to get all the access it doesn't matter
 it's it's completely your own call it's
 not needed but the point is that you
 just start immersing yourself so that's
 it for Community let's move on to
 chapter two
 all right now let's talk about how to
 learn ta and why you're going to want to
 learn ta this is going to be a bit of a
 bulkier chapter because we're going to
 have to go through quite a bit and
 there's going to be tons of resources
 and links so I just want to start this
 chapter by saying
 um hang in there it's going to take a
 while to get all this information out
 and if you get lost in in all this I'll
 try to make it as easy as possible but
 if you get lost in all this I'm going to
 have in the description of this video
 kind of every single thing that I list
 in order so you'll be able to say okay I
 remember he talked about level three and
 that says level three right here so
 that's what I need to go to so I want to
 talk about why we learn ta and how to
 learn ta so before I get into where to
 learn it let's talk about why we should
 learn it technical analysis which is TA
 is everything that controls the day
 trading stock markets and everything
 that always has from 200 years ago to
 now so the things we want to avoid
 um just to start is any kind of signals
 groups so you're going to see this all
 over the internet people are selling
 signals to
 trades and they're saying well for 20 a
 month or 30 a month you can join our
 signals and make all this money
 um and like even I offer that too for my
 more advanced members but that's not a
 good way to build a career if you have
 to rely on somebody else to give you
 signals
 um what happens if they get into court
 car accident one day and your career is
 built off somebody else's signals and
 then all of a sudden they're gone and
 your career is gone like it's not a very
 sustainable way to live and you're also
 just trusting other people it would be
 the same thing as just blindly throwing
 um a dart at a dart board and wherever
 it lands that's the kind of stock that
 you go into you should never ever trust
 anybody else you should always do your
 own research do your own charts do your
 own technical analysis and make the
 decisions on your own because if you
 learn properly you should be like if you
 take my courses and learn properly you
 should be better than 99 of people out
 there anyways because my courses are
 very deep they're very intricate and
 they're very tough but after you know
 six months or a year of studying you can
 you can you'd be better than 99 of these
 signals groups anyways
 um matter of fact there's thousands of
 signals groups out there that just use
 my course material and and just reshape
 it to make signals groups out of it so a
 solid chunk of our industry is just made
 up of signals groups that have learned
 from my courses anyways who are doing it
 haphazardly so you're always going to be
 better to stay away from that learn on
 your own and then make your own
 decisions so that you have control of
 your career and control of your own
 finances so when you want to scale up
 and make five thousand dollars a day you
 can because you know how and if you just
 start at ten dollars a day you have a
 very direct path to say okay I'm making
 10 bucks a day now I need to make 100 a
 day and now I need to make three or four
 hundred dollars a day so you have a
 direct controller over your own career
 so that is important to know so stay
 away from signals groups we never use
 indicators real day Traders don't use
 indicators because now I'm not saying
 you can't make money using indicators
 but they're a very poor way to do things
 it's like
 um you have a mechanic who is been doing
 uh it for 20 years who's a pro who can
 tackle every problem who knows every
 single thing to fix on a car they see a
 car and they're like oh yeah just by the
 sound I know I know what's wrong with it
 versus is somebody who has just gotten
 their first wrench set and doesn't
 really know what they're doing is just
 kind of taking things apart to kind of
 figure it out it's the same thing like
 we don't you can make money using
 indicators but it is such a poor way to
 do it it is so unoptimized it is about
 five percent of the results of actually
 doing it yourself so just like
 indicators stay away from them it
 doesn't matter what it is we don't use
 moving averages we don't use v-wops
 um EMA's smas RSI Divergence there's
 always a new indicator coming out in the
 market that's the next best thing but
 they all suck because you can be
 accurate 90 plus percent of the time if
 you learn how to do technical analysis
 properly and the fact of the matter is
 indicators are a business of their own
 so people make indicators to sell them
 to make money or they make them to get
 more views on a training software
 because that trading software then gives
 them a kickback so releasing indicators
 is a business model of their own and
 they don't really work again you can
 make money but if you were making a
 hundred dollars a day with an indica
 later that same Trader if he learned
 technical analysis properly he can make
 five thousand dollars a day instead of a
 hundred dollars a day so you're really
 shortcutting yourself so do not use
 indicators or any type we also don't
 trade anything to do with the news the
 news makes no difference in our in our
 day trading careers I don't even look at
 the news
 I have like a 95 to 99 accuracy ratio in
 a chart I've been doing it for years
 publicly that's all cross-checkable you
 can go take a look at old footage of
 mine on streams on charts even in my
 courses where I've called things on my
 accuracy ratio was insane and it's not
 to brag but it's just to show that I
 don't ever look at the news and neither
 do any of the good traders that I know
 I've been doing this for 12 13 years and
 I've met thousands if not tens of
 thousands of Traders traders who are
 making over 10 million a year traders
 who are just starting their career none
 of them use the news articles very
 rarely do I come across somebody but
 actually when you get exp using news
 articles is kind of like this amateurish
 thing to do it's like when you first
 start day trading you're talking about
 ah the new points are coming out today
 and oh my God the uh the the the the Dow
 is doing this or whatever that's like
 really fun and exciting and kind of like
 a lost puppy dog or like a university
 one student talking to somebody studying
 their masters on their final year it's
 like okay dude yeah cool man points are
 coming out today that the federal
 meetings yeah Cole did like it's so
 amateurish and puppy doggish that once
 you get like a year into day trading
 you're just gonna be like why why did I
 used to talk about news this
 doesn't make any sense this stuff all
 happens
 you know before the charts uh even show
 the news articles anyway so save
 yourself the hassle and the
 embarrassment of being like the news
 Trader and the guy that everybody looks
 at like you talk about news and all the
 real traders in them are like that guy's
 new you know like save yourself that
 embarrassment don't use the news
 um so those are the couple things you
 want to stay away from and um everything
 on the charts is controlled by technical
 analysis which has always been there for
 hundreds of years before computers are
 around they used to record it on paper
 that data has now been putting onto
 charts you can go and take my science
 and back test it back to the early 1800s
 and you'll see that all these same
 events that have been happening for the
 last 200 and 300 years they're still
 happening so there's a science that
 controls the markets and it's called
 technical analysis so you have to learn
 what controls the markets in order to
 know where the right spots to buy and
 sell are so it's a very simple equation
 so technical analysis is what you want
 to learn and that's why you want to
 learn it because it'll give you an
 accuracy that nothing else in the world
 can and those are some of the things you
 want to stay away from so that big
 long-winded explanation let's actually
 get into where to learn technical
 analysis now so you're going to want to
 learn on my channel I've devoted my
 whole entire career to cracking the
 stock markets to reverse engineering
 them to back testing this stuff to
 creating a system that people can follow
 and I released it to the world for free
 so it's all on my YouTube channel the
 same channel that uh has all my content
 and I go through absolutely everything
 in a very in-depth way now a disclaimer
 is that it's not going to be something
 where you can watch one or two videos
 and you're going to be banged done
 that's it that's not realistic thinking
 it's not realistic to say hey I can make
 a million dollars a year as a day trader
 um by just doing an afternoon or a
 weekend of work it's just not it doesn't
 align with reality
 so the disclaimer is that you might be
 studying my material for a year by the
 time you get through all my videos I
 have like 300 videos and they're all
 like an hour to two hours long some of
 them are 15 minutes some of them are
 four hours long but they're all
 different forms of technical analysis
 we're not talking about videos where
 you know one video I'm talking about hey
 guys look at my new card and that
 another video is like oh this is a quick
 little hack that you're going to want to
 do no these are like 300 lessons of
 Hardcore studying this is data point x
 so when data point x hits we call this a
 whole level and if this whole level hits
 then it's going to go to the other side
 of the chart here and mirror it as a
 Pandora's box and all these
 terminologies that I've created I've
 spent a lifetime reverse engineering
 this stuff in a lifetime creating it so
 it is a hardcore deep set of Science and
 rules that you're going to want to learn
 so don't expect it to be done quick and
 if you're not here for the Long Haul if
 this doesn't sound like it's for you
 that sucks I'm sorry to hear but I don't
 want to sugarcoat things if this sounds
 too hard for you you should just stop
 the video now go somewhere else but if
 you're ready for the challenge ready to
 learn and ready to have a real career
 where you can make seven figures here
 you can learn how to be a real day
 trader without the fluff in the industry
 without all the stuff they try to sell
 you and feed you all all the things
 where it's like here join this course or
 join this mailing list they're just 25
 bucks a month if you want the real way
 to be a day trader without all the
 modern fluff where people are trying to
 just monetize on it then watch my
 courses because it's going to teach you
 everything from zero to 100 and if you
 don't believe me join the Discord which
 is free and we have like five to ten
 thousand members in there and just ask
 them and every single member in there is
 going to be like no cotton candy stuff
 is I wish I knew it sooner
 um it's the best I've ever had blah blah
 they're just gonna tell you the truth
 just like I am now so
 with that said now let's go into how to
 learn these different things and and
 where you're going to learn them and how
 I've set up to structure to help you to
 learn this stuff so I I create my lists
 like this level one level two level
 three level four level five level six
 and mentorship so you're gonna start at
 level one level one is the lowest level
 where you're gonna start from zero so
 level one
 is going to be your beginner's course
 materials this is a long video
 let me get a drink here level one is
 going to be
 um your beginner's core stuff so level
 one focuses on
 kind of just
 building your foundation it has
 everything from a setup what you should
 first look at when you open your charts
 and how to uh how to install the tools
 and what to look at to just getting in
 some basic concepts like accumulation
 levels Trends targets time frames level
 adaptation and a little bit of trading
 so level one really is just
 um I'm just learning how to day trade I
 need to start from zero I don't even
 know what programs to use level one is
 where you want to start so level one is
 eight courses and it's not gonna take
 you too long because I made it very
 digestible and that's where you're going
 to want to start then when you're done
 level one obviously you're gonna move on
 to level two and level two is going to
 be kind of like the more advanced form
 of level one it's saying I just learned
 how to trade I've just started to Mark
 levels I've completely brand new I just
 started this week I actually know some
 terminologies now and like I know how to
 draw a level I know how to draw a trend
 and I know why we do them level two is
 going to start to emphasize on that a
 little bit it's going to say okay you
 learn those things now let's tweak them
 a little bit for a more advanced setup
 so now we're starting to become
 professional Traders a little bit not
 professionals and we can make money at
 but professional is in
 these are just more advanced terms that
 we can use and it just kind of gets us
 to a place where we're not lost like if
 you're in a community and you're talking
 about things you could keep up you would
 know all these terminologies so it kind
 of lets you look at a chart and keep up
 with everybody else right all the
 advanced Traders now there's kind of two
 sections of of level two the first half
 is that Pro stuff that I just talked
 about there the second half is all
 mental analysis now I like to really
 break mental analysis down for people
 from an early place because I don't want
 them going and doing five months of work
 to think like oh this is it how do I
 deal with all this stress
 um how do I deal with the losses how do
 I deal with the gains I want people to
 understand that mental analysis is a
 huge component of our journey as day
 trades so I have a mental analysis
 course in there called mental analysis
 evolved and I created a system called
 devices and devices is an acronym for
 um dexterity endurance Vitality the eye
 is intelligence the wait yeah yeah okay
 I spelled that right sorry uh C is
 charisma the E is what is the other
 energy and then the x s is strength I
 think I spelled that right I don't know
 I probably have some stuff in there and
 so I made a system called devices it's
 an acronym that we can use to
 um better help understand how our mind
 works so I have everything from
 roadblock to deal with roadblocks in
 there how to have more energy and day
 trading how to have a stronger mindset
 how to use your intelligence and and
 what to filter and what not to filter
 for thoughts how to become trading
 longer how to survive longer in trading
 so I really wanted to take almost like a
 video game kind of acronym and create a
 set of Mind Tools around it now I look
 at mental analysis a little differently
 than most people there's um some books
 and stuff that have been published I
 won't get into like books from the past
 that have been published but a lot of
 stuff when you think of mental analysis
 and how to trade and the cues of our
 mind when you think of that stuff you
 think a lot of
 um
 most books will will give you pieces
 like this oh don't stress about trading
 you can't control it so they're kind of
 just like afterthought realizations so
 it's like don't stress you can't control
 the outcomes don't get upset if you go
 and get uh on tilt or if you go and
 you're flying off the handles you're
 going to lose more money so you need to
 step away and take a break take a breath
 it's more post realization it doesn't
 really build any tools to help you
 become a better
 Trader in terms of mental analysis
 instead what I try to do is I try to
 tackle things like brain fog and how to
 reduce it I try to take a proactive
 approach on mental analysis and I try to
 use it to create tools as almost like a
 mind science just like my day trading
 science I kind of like to think of
 things in terms of science it's like how
 can we have more energy in trading right
 like how can we make better quality
 decisions so what times of the day is it
 most optimized to trade and if we have a
 most optimized time based on our bio
 clocks then how do you increase the
 efficiency of that bio-clock time so
 these are like preactive ways of
 thinking about mind training or mind
 Sciences tweaking the way that we can
 use our mind or how do we reduce brain
 fog how can we proactively make sure we
 never get brain fog right things like
 that what are roadblocks and what are
 environmental triggers things like that
 so I take a look at mind Sciences very
 differently and I think this is really
 important for level two to go and learn
 about these things and to constantly
 come back to this part of level two and
 just retrain it because the mental
 analysis work that I do it probably took
 me a solid six to nine months to develop
 all this stuff and it's a quick I want
 to say it's like 12 videos I think I
 think it's around 12 videos and they're
 you know 10 12 minutes each but they're
 they're they're golden nuggets and they
 have been the anchor points for a lot of
 my really professional Traders and and
 people have come back to me years later
 saying I didn't realize how important
 your your work on mental analysis was
 like it completely changed the
 perspective of how I see the day trading
 charts so that's level two so you are
 going to come back to level two now
 let's move on to level three here level
 three is what I call the future of
 trading so this is like your first
 Advanced set of tools so level one and
 two focus on how to just set up and
 almost like year one of University level
 two breaks you into your first specified
 task set so now you have things like
 hard close the effect of time break
 levels whole levels really the
 professional tools that we start to use
 as day Traders now the things that we'll
 start to use for their rest of our
 career so we're building the foundation
 in lesson three of these are the tools
 we use but here's an introduction to
 them all so level of one and two catch
 you up to a place where you could
 understand what level three looks like
 and then level three builds the tools
 that we use forward for the future of
 everything we will need to do so level
 three might be a good spot to start for
 somebody who's already been day trading
 for three or four years somebody who's
 already in the field but isn't
 successful or somebody who's like oh I'm
 successful but I want to become more
 successful in order really how the
 charts work in the deepest form of
 technical analysis that there is level
 three would be a good place for that
 person to start or if you're new and
 you've done level one and two
 these are gonna be like your tools that
 you use for the future so you're you're
 if your doctor your stethoscope your
 heart monitor doesn't mean you can't
 learn more about them and there's more
 deeper forms and how to cross combine
 those with other tools but this is those
 tools that will
 um founder the the building blocks of
 your professional career so that's level
 three and then we get into level four
 which now we start to have a definement
 in the way that day trading works so the
 way I see it is there's three lanes in
 day trading so you have three separate
 Lanes in the way the day trading works
 you have procedural analysis and
 procedural which is I call Pa is
 everything that happens before a trade
 which is your level four so now that
 we've learned the tools we're now going
 and breaking that away from that
 structure of okay here's a set of tools
 in a very chronological way level one
 level two level three now we're breaking
 into a more advanced form of day trading
 saying okay now that we understand the
 tools we need now we need to understand
 the ethos of trading or or like how the
 lanes exist so the first Lane is
 everything that happens before a trade
 the the final Lane is everything that
 happens after a trade and in between
 which is the second lane which is right
 in the middle is everything that happens
 during a trade so we kind of have three
 different areas where these trades live
 and exist so three lanes of trading so
 level four breaks into the very first
 Lane of trading which is procedural
 analysis so this is understanding
 everything that happens before a trade
 actually executes so all the setup that
 you need to do all the different types
 of things you should look at to
 understand what to do in the moment when
 that moment occurs so this is called PA
 procedural analysis and that's all of
 level four you're gonna be talking about
 things like timing bankroll management
 how to define a market where expectation
 should be so everything that you can
 think of that would happen before a
 trade that's your level four now we go
 into level five which is a course I call
 Butterfly Effect this is the second lane
 of trading which is comparative analysis
 so CA now comparative analysis kind of
 flows from lane two to three and back
 and forth but butterfly effect is
 comparative analysis right so we need
 comparative analysis to understand how
 to compare the events of what happened
 in the past and the current moments like
 if if Bitcoin for example is flying out
 of its mind and it just jumped ten
 percent up you have to understand
 where it's going to its next Target
 because it might have blown through
 three or four targets so comparatively
 you have to see what's happening in the
 moment the best understand what's going
 to happen next and for this reason I
 call this CA which is comparative
 analysis so this lives inside of that
 final Lane because you're constantly
 comparing events at the end of the
 trades so remember procedural analysis
 which is Lane one that's everything
 before comparative analysis is
 everything after which is and it flows
 into the current as well so it kind of
 shares two and three so so this is
 comparing the events of the current and
 before we jump forward to level six and
 all that we're going to talk about the
 Middle Lane which is risk assessment or
 ra so procedural analysis before risk
 and how to assess it during the trade
 and then comparative comes right after
 risk so it's almost kind of like Lane
 2.5 and 3. so then you have everything
 that happens before during and after the
 trade and then it just goes into a full
 circle cycle because after the trade is
 actually what happens before the next
 trade if you were to just say oh well
 the next trade is going to come then you
 get back into Lane one because rate has
 happened and you're now looking at the
 third lane which then turns into Lane
 one so it's kind of like this full
 circle thing where it's this perfect
 cycle right it's how day trading works
 so level five gets into comparative
 analysis and all your really Advanced
 tool sets and how to use them
 um you know taking what we learned in
 three and then building on top of three
 so as if you were building a pyramid you
 know your pyramid starts at three and
 then understanding how to build that
 pyramid and creating a map that would be
 like level one and two but you're
 actually building the pyramid at level
 three and then level five is actually
 starting to build those blocks on top so
 now you're starting to like fill in more
 advanced forms of uh day trading and
 level six becomes a more advanced
 version of that even so comparative
 analysis is really where our Focus lies
 hugely in day trading because if we
 think of lane two and three which is
 risk assessment and comparative analysis
 those are the two things that happen
 after a trade that we constantly have to
 be processing data thinking about and
 really looking and saying okay what's
 happening next what's happening
 currently how is this affecting my
 current trade because trading is not a
 set it and forget a type of thing
 trading is a hit a Target enter trade
 and then look at the variables that have
 happened to best decide what the next
 outcome is you can't just it's not a
 it's not a pot roast you can't set it
 and forget it you there's forms of
 trading that you can do that but we're
 not talking about that today that's like
 scalp trading and position trading and I
 go I go into that in the courses so
 actually in level five and six and four
 you can go and see all that stuff so
 that's actually covered inside the
 courses not no need to talk about it in
 this video so level six is an even more
 advanced form of comparative analysis
 where you're getting to the actual final
 nuances the things that would you know
 separate somebody who would be still in
 University to to somebody who's been
 doing it 15 years and is acclaimed as
 one of the best in the world right like
 that's the difference it's the same
 comparative analysis cue set but you're
 really getting into like the hard core
 lessons and the hardcore training where
 you actually learn even deeper and
 deeper things so that's kind of lessons
 or levels one through six and how you
 should look at them in the ordinance
 that you should take them in and why you
 take them in those ways
 beyond that I have a risk assessment
 guide and risk
 um which is that second lane I have a
 risk assessment guide and a stop loss
 guide which I'll also Link in the video
 which kind of go hand in hand with that
 second lane that risk analysis so
 outside of level one through six I have
 a few videos I'm going to recommend
 where they're a bit of a bulkier video
 it's like an hour two hours long
 specifically which is like a guide on
 risk a guide on scalping
 um think things of that nature or stop
 losses and why we would use stop losses
 the way we do so those are going to be
 outside of level one through six and you
 take them
 um at your own discretion like I would
 take
 at level four when I when I completed
 level four I would take the stop loss
 guide when I completed level five I
 would take the risk assessment guide and
 then at level six I would go and take
 that stop loss and risk assessment guide
 again uh which will be linked in the
 description I would take those same two
 again and I would take them a second
 time so I refresh uh my my knowledge on
 them because those are two kind of
 critical components
 now we get into mentorship so I do have
 also mentorship that I have uh as well
 which I'm gonna put those lessons in in
 here also so that then there's the
 mentorship videos that you're gonna go
 through so there's like 35 or 40 of them
 something like that where there's
 mentorship lessons
 um which are all accessible by the way
 as well I'll leave the link in in the
 description of this video
 I have mentorship lessons where you're
 going to go and you're going to use
 those mentorship lessons
 after you complete level six
 with the understanding that the
 mentorship lessons are all on level five
 so I go through every single lesson on
 lesson five because there's about 70 or
 so lessons
 um some some formats I have them
 condensed to be 30 lessons some it's 70
 on YouTube I believe it's 75 lessons so
 I go through in mentorship and they're
 long lessons they're about an hour to
 two hours some some of them are three
 and four hours each and I'm gonna go and
 say okay this was level five lesson one
 through three for example and I'm gonna
 go and talk about that for two hours so
 what you need to do with the mentorship
 lessons is take them either in
 conjunction with level five right you
 need to either take them beside level
 five so you do
 um level lesson one two and three in
 level five and then take mentorship
 lesson one so you need to either connect
 them hand in hand like finish one two
 three on level five and then say okay I
 finished those now I want a deeper
 understanding let's take mentorship
 or just complete all of five and then
 complete all of level six and then take
 mentorship afterwards and then complete
 level six again that's the way I would
 do it because it's just a more com like
 it's just a more compounded set of
 knowledge I would go level five level
 six all of mentorship and then level six
 again
 personally that's how I do but you can
 you can do either way I think you're
 gonna get the same kind of benefit doing
 either way maybe this way you you get a
 little bit more benefit because you're
 doing level six twice so you do it once
 before mentorship you take mentorship
 and then you do it again after and it's
 kind of like just ingrains it further
 into your mind and uh that would be like
 how you learn technical analysis
 from zero to a hundred and then just
 keeping up with my with my platforms and
 saying like oh he just released a new
 lesson let me take that right like I'm
 obviously going to continue to release
 knowledge but like there's people who
 are who are done level five and they
 make seven figures a year there's people
 who are done six level six and they make
 high seven figures we're talking about
 five six seven million dollars a year so
 that this is more than enough even if
 you were to just stop at level six or
 even at level I wouldn't stop at level
 five like why why when you can just be
 better if you were to complete level six
 that would be more than enough and
 mentorship that would be more than
 enough to give yourself any any income
 that you uh desire or work for any firm
 in the world
 um you know be hired by the best firms
 or just work for yourself that is your
 whole entire chapter to markdown it's
 been a a long chapter too that's the
 entire markdown but that is everything
 you're going to want to learn in
 technical analysis how to do it the
 steps to follow it what you're going to
 learn and why you want to learn it in
 that queue and don't forget to go back
 and do level two mental analysis again
 over and over you should be a normal
 routine just a course that you're
 constantly taking and it's like oh this
 is a refresher oh I want to do mental
 analysis oh it's a good training for my
 mind oh I've done it six times I'm
 really successful let me do the seventh
 time right like that's that's a good way
 to to look at it so uh let's move on to
 the next chapter
 okay chapter three softwares and
 exchanges what to use so software is
 this one's going to be very easy you
 don't need to go out and buy all these
 extra things like trading journals and
 stuff like that I'm going to include a
 trading journal format that I use which
 is just a simple Excel sheet
 um I will share a link for a just blank
 sheet that you can download and use and
 it'll allow you to kind of take take
 notes and track some of the things you
 need SO trading journals and stuff like
 that we don't need to worry about
 um I'll get to that a little later on
 here there's no other softwares or
 things you'd want to download no like
 algorithms or Bots or anything that
 stays far away from all that stuff as
 you can
 so for software is the only thing you
 really need is trading view
 tradingview.com which is where we do all
 of our day trading charts on so
 tradingview.com you can use a free
 version you don't need to pay for any of
 the extended versions
 um everything you will need on trading
 view is available on the free version
 you don't really need alerts
 um I'm not really a big fan of alerts
 because the thing about alerts even
 though some people say like oh alerts
 are great because I can get a message
 from my to my cell phone and it can be
 you know four in the afternoon and I'm
 not trading the thing about day trading
 is you want to create a stabilized
 routine and not live your life around
 alerts I find this is something that
 newer Traders do is they have alerts
 on prices because they're waiting for
 certain moments to hit but really the
 reality of it is that as a professional
 day trader you should be able to you
 know wake up at 8 8 A.M or wake up at
 5am or whatever time you wake up you
 should be able to go on your charts for
 three or four hours take your trades
 walk away not have to walk away take two
 hours away alerts are going to your cell
 phones you run back to your office or
 your trading room or your basement or
 garage or wherever your training station
 is and then you're sitting there and
 you're sinking another half an hour into
 it and then you leave and then you're
 managing trades or you're in your off
 time like this isn't a healthy way to
 day trade it's not a healthy way to be a
 day trader it's not a healthy routine to
 have so really what you want to do is
 you don't really need alerts you want to
 be having like your four or five hours
 or even two to three hours or one hour
 if it's if it's if you can accomplish in
 one hour of just straight training time
 and then outside of that you want to
 just say like okay I'm not trading time
 to be a normal human being because how
 crappy would that be a career as a
 mechanic if you worked your eight hour
 shift and then you were also on call 24
 7 and it's like well dude I need to have
 a life too so it's not really a healthy
 thing to get into so I don't really see
 a lot of paid features that I like on
 trading view you don't need more than
 one window maybe two so like the two
 split screen on trading view where you
 have side by side some people say like
 oh I need four and five and six and all
 that you really only need one chart you
 don't need to watch multiple at a time
 you don't need any additional indicators
 you don't need any additional time
 frames like most of the stuff is
 available on the free version of trading
 View
 I would say for nine out of 10 people
 they would probably be perfectly fine
 with the with a normal version and you
 wouldn't be at any disadvantage by using
 the free version either the only things
 that you get for the paid version that
 are kind of useful is no ads because I
 hate seeing the ad pop-ups they really
 are distracting for me
 so that's helpful and the replayer tool
 is good
 um outside of that there's there's
 nothing you don't need extended time
 frames you don't need all the stuff that
 they try to sell you you don't need it
 so at the most you should be getting the
 very cheapest level subscription you can
 on trading you if you find you need it
 so if you're doing really well and you
 want those few features like the replay
 tool and the no ads great use it um
 replayer tool can be a great training
 tool but other than that there's there's
 not a lot you need I find trading View
 for the most part 90 of the things they
 put on the website are pretty unusable
 and useless so you know hopefully we'll
 see a trading view alternative one day
 that's nice cheap
 um nice cheap alternative that doesn't
 have all the extra bloat that's useless
 so for software you really don't need
 anything and what I'm going to do now
 actually is I am going to give you
 quick little peek into what I do for
 um
 I'm going to do is I'm going to give you
 a quick little peek into what I use for
 my trading tool let's make this nice and
 big so everybody can see okay so
 um really if you're if you're looking at
 you know recording some data here you
 you don't need a trading journal the
 thing I find about trading journals is
 like they they import data and there's
 so much bloat that
 um it just syncs up all of your time to
 kind of Cipher through all that bloat
 and uh it just it just kind of takes up
 way too much time to sit there and go
 through it all and it's importing fields
 that you don't need and then it just
 becomes a strain on your mind because
 you're trying to decipher all this
 information that's not usable so I just
 have a simple Excel sheet here that I'm
 going to share with uh with everybody
 and it's just got your p l it's you have
 day one day two day three day four day
 five day six so if you really feel like
 you need to track your progress which
 you won't always do you won't always
 need to track your progress but if you
 do feel like you need to some people
 like to some people don't I don't think
 there's a benefit or a default either
 way I think it's great as a mental
 analysis tool as your training to use
 this but again and then some people they
 just start becoming successful and they
 get away from me because I don't need it
 p l which is profit and loss what time
 you start each day that way you can say
 like oh hey I have more profits on this
 day and less profits on day three
 because maybe I started at 8am here and
 on this day I started at 10 am and my
 well let's do that properly here 10 a.m
 right so then maybe my profits were
 plus four that's fine
 um we'll go plus four on this day and on
 this day they were only one percent
 right so let's say they were actually
 negative one on this day so if I'm
 waking up later in the day and it's
 negative one there's obviously a
 misalignment there or mismatch clearly
 I'm going to be more profitable when I'm
 waking up early so also it can be a nice
 tool to help you kind of track those
 things and say like hey you know I've
 obviously making some errors here and
 these are the days where it's where it's
 higher and then
 um you know you can rank your mental
 analysis your comparative analysis your
 procedural analysis your risk assessment
 and your technical analysis you can rank
 those one through ten in here
 um your Market meta which I get into in
 the courses how how good your Market mat
 is how long you've been trading for so
 if today you traded for three hours and
 you woke up late and traded for eight
 hours obviously you woke up late you
 traded for way too long your whole day
 was consumed by trading and you ended up
 making a negative profit clearly this is
 a much better day you have four percent
 profits total you started nice and early
 in the morning at 8am and you had a
 three hour training it was four percent
 Bank really good how how many
 distractions you had what your diet
 looks like your sleep your focus your
 macro diet which is nutritions like
 vitamins and stuff like that I'm not
 sure if that's the correct term if it's
 macro micro but I believe macros your uh
 nutrients TS ratio is trading to
 studying so if I trade for two hours and
 and study for
 um four hours my trading ratio is one to
 two right because I have twice the
 amount of time studying that I do
 trading and uh if this day if it was you
 know three to one for example and I
 traded way more than I studied I clearly
 over traded for way too many hours that
 means I I traded for six hours and
 studied for two and that was obviously
 way too long of studying waking up late
 so you can start to see how you can
 cross compare these things how much
 family time you spent whether it's 30
 minutes an hour two hours how much Flex
 time you gave yourself the number of
 Trades you took maybe you took four
 trades on this day maybe you took 26
 trades on this day clearly you you know
 traded way too long way too late in the
 day took way too many trades time on
 t-a-c-a-p-a-m-a number of scalps use
 these fields as you see necessary but
 the benefit of this is being able to
 cross compare them number of scallops
 you took number of swings you took
 number of positions whether you trade
 Forex crypto or stocks what your
 accuracy was how is your confidence
 level and then a fun one
 um caffeine caffeine is like a nice one
 like did you have tons of caffeine today
 or did you have only a little bit of
 caffeine maybe that has an effect on you
 too so I'll leave a link for this
 in the uh in in the description but this
 can help you be a nice little piece of
 software something that I do use when I
 uh when I Mentor people and something
 that I go through with them and we
 decipher it but it could be a really
 cool tool to use and it'll avoid you
 having to pay for
 um you know like a trading journal which
 I think is kind of a waste of money
 because they import all this data that
 you don't need and it's like percentages
 and pie charts and it's like dude yeah I
 don't need that crap I just need to be
 able to decipher my information and make
 myself better very quick and easy and a
 fast way to do it
 um so that should like wrap up softwares
 now for Brokers
 um you know you get into this big thing
 like which broker should I use and I'm
 gonna put some links for brokers in the
 chat I think there's a lot of Brokers
 with um
 different benefits the big ones I won't
 say any which one I prefer
 I'm gonna have a different video
 completely where I'm gonna go and I'm
 going to look at
 um 15 Brokers and I'm going to do a
 cross comparison and rank them so I'm
 going to make that a separate video from
 this so this video what I'm going to say
 is the broker that you use
 like binance is going to be a good one
 for sure I'll leave a link for the
 binance
 um referral in there Mexi is pretty
 decent too and uh bit get those those
 are three kind of good ones so I'm going
 to leave you with three links in this
 video but I'm gonna make a full video on
 Brokers and in another separate video
 but I'm going to leave you with a
 binance link I'm going to leave you with
 a bit get link and I'm going to leave
 you with a Mex C link I think those
 three are good and safe to pick between
 those three for now until we can get
 into like a whole big hour-long cross
 comparison charts and stuff like that
 but that's going to be a whole nother
 project that's a whole nother beast but
 I'll leave you with those three
 um I'll make sure that each of them are
 set up to give you guys bonuses and
 benefits like you know I think
 I think I can do like
 um
 Mexi for example I think you get like
 nine thousand dollars in in benefits and
 bonuses so maybe you want to go to Maxi
 and get those bonuses and then on bit
 get maybe I can do one where it's like
 you know the same thing nine thousand
 you might want to have both accounts and
 just back jump back and forth to get the
 bounties and then ultimately in in the
 end use binance I wouldn't use anything
 outside of those three
 um I would probably say that for the
 safest bet you're gonna be on binance
 and for the um you know second and third
 safest it's going to be Maxi and bitget
 but use those three for now until I can
 make a full video breakdown on this but
 you know the Brokers you should stick to
 the main ones I will say a few words
 about this you should stick to those
 main Brokers because there's a lot of
 Brokers that come and go in our industry
 and the last thing you want to happen
 have happen is you have ten thousand
 dollars or fifty thousand or you know
 two two million dollars in an account
 and then all of a sudden The Brokerage
 disappears it's happened before encrypt
 on it'll happen again and all stock
 markets not just crypto it happens right
 so like you want to be with a bigger
 bigger exchanges so that that doesn't
 have but you don't want to be going to
 the little unknown new exchanges so I
 will recommend those three in this video
 and then do another video taking like
 the top 15 and making a complete
 brokerage guide
 okay everybody chapter four The Life of
 a day trader
 720 I've had my coffee I've had my
 breakfast I've worked out I've gotten
 ready for the day I was up at about 5 30
 probably uh just so I can have a few
 hours to myself and just I only did like
 20 minutes of cardio I'll do a big
 workout later but at least it gave me
 some time to myself to just
 um yeah wake up have a few
 few calm moments check social stuff like
 that but now it's time to trade and it's
 uh trying to start for about 7 30 a.m
 today so
 um yeah I'll give you a quick little
 tour of the office I won't do a full
 video that's going to show from morning
 till night maybe maybe in the future
 here I'll do the life of a day trade or
 a full version but I'm just going to
 talk about my office space today and
 what it looks like every day so by 7 30
 I come here this is my guest house I
 have kind of a couple couple different
 houses on my property here and this is
 one of my guest houses so I have a car
 lift in here and I converted it from a
 mechanic shop to mechanics kind of
 like a car lift mechanic thing also into
 a gym so throughout the day whenever I
 need a break I just kind of come down
 here maybe I'll hit up my exercise bike
 do a few minutes of cardio maybe I'll
 lift some of my weight bags just
 different things right like I just come
 down here to get that that little bit of
 Solace and upstairs is where my training
 cave is or content Creation Station or
 whatever you'd call it so I think it's
 really important as we walk up there I'm
 going to talk about this I think it's
 really important that no matter where
 you're
 your space is or where you're trading
 you have to take pride in that space and
 make it something very beautiful
 something that you want to be in every
 day I think that positive energy is
 definitely something that carries
 through
 in your trading success right so whether
 it's in a basement or
 a garage like mine or a coach house I
 should say like mine a secondary home or
 an external office space or even just
 like a bedroom I think it's really
 important to have that really beautiful
 space to keep uh
 just to keep spirits up right nice
 artwork
 kind of got all the nice couches and
 plants and lights and
 everything like that and I got my
 trading slash content Creation Station
 kind of thing
 then I also have just like a nice
 nice kitchen here throwing on it the
 coffee or I'll just make some food or
 whatever
 and do something else
 um yeah it's just like a really nice
 space that I can go and
 chill out and trade but it's almost 7 30
 here so we're gonna start trading soon
 let's go over to the
 office
 all right so you just saw the office you
 just saw a bit of a walk through and
 let's just talk about what the day
 trading day looks like I've got my chart
 on the bottom left side of the screen
 here if you not figure for a second here
 so you can see that and what I'm going
 to do here is I'm going to start to get
 to trading in a moment but I just want
 to talk a little bit about my day and
 what the structure of it looks like so
 again I wake up pretty early usually I'm
 up sometimes even as up at 4am I don't
 need to be but 4 a.m 5 a.m if I find at
 6 a.m I'm starting to go crazy I feel
 like I've slept for
 yeah I don't know how long but a long
 time feel like I've slept through winter
 um so so by about six o'clock at the
 latest I'm up I'm I'm exercising I'm
 getting food I'm getting coffee I'm just
 doing a few things that I do every day
 like every day I make sure I exercise
 just a little bit just get my joints
 moving just you know make my body feel
 good after that I get my coffee I get my
 breakfast something healthy avocados
 scrambled eggs on a wrap something like
 that that doesn't matter just healthy
 food in the in the morning keep my mind
 active and fresh and I keep my impact to
 low and the reason I do this the reason
 I wake up so early is because I like to
 have that bit of my morning time my kids
 wake up around maybe eight and I like to
 have that one or two hours to myself in
 the morning or I can wake up I don't
 have to change diapers and I don't have
 to feed five-year-olds and get them
 ready for school and things like that so
 what I what I do get to do is I get to
 um just have that two hours to myself or
 wake up exercise I don't have any
 distractions I don't want to start
 filling my mind with a bunch of chaotic
 thoughts a bunch of overly emotional
 moments whether they'd be happy or sad
 at kids stuff says tell when he's crying
 and you have to go fix it or he's really
 happy because he just be the level of
 Mario just whatever whatever whatever it
 is I just don't like all that emotional
 heaviness on me before I trade I like to
 keep it as neutral as possible almost as
 if I don't have this is going to sound
 weird but almost as if I don't have a
 soul before I'm done trading like I
 don't actually come alive on a personal
 level until I'm actually done trading
 for the day which is weird to say but
 it's like I get to stay as neutral as
 possible I just get to focus on my 20
 minutes of workout I work hard I'm
 focused I'm tuned in I eat a healthy
 breakfast I get my coffee I shower I get
 ready and then I jump to work and
 nothing has happened on the day and this
 is the best way I find to start your day
 trading day because you're just
 completely neutral flatlined emotionally
 and uh yeah you're just in a good space
 without any distractions right and it
 keeps your schedule very tuned in so if
 you if you have kids or you have other
 allegations that happen a little later
 on in the day Pro tip wake up at 4am 5am
 get that stuff done
 now we start trading for the day so it's
 about 7 30 now maybe it's like 7 35 or
 something like that my local time here
 and it's time to start trading for the
 day
 what time is it actually oh it's uh 8
 15.
 um I have my time set a little
 differently here it's 8 15 in the
 morning okay so still pretty early took
 a little bit longer than I thought to
 record so then my day is going to look
 like this I'm gonna I'm gonna open up
 the charts I'm gonna start looking at
 all the different
 um
 ways that we can make money in in the
 markets today I'm going to be looking at
 some some whole level stuff like that
 I'm not going to go through too much but
 obviously we just hit a weekly hold
 level here
 let's move this to the bottom like that
 we just had a weekly whole level here
 and uh we're gonna need to look for
 what's next in uh in Bitcoin so then we
 would just simply start marking out
 levels and and doing our job as a day
 trader to find the different
 opportunities in the market start
 marking out your whole levels you've got
 one two there that would have been a
 nice little short opportunity to start
 looking at lower time frames maybe even
 going as high as this start color coding
 things and uh yeah C'est La Vie we're
 going to be Off to the Races looking for
 some different opportunities on the
 markets today can't have this one that
 obviously got hard clothes so you'd be
 something like this so combination
 levels from here to here and also to
 that so you got a few levels on the
 charts
 um yeah those four hour red is daily and
 purple is weekly so obviously if the
 weekly holds us down we're gonna have a
 pretty good pretty good short
 opportunity here so if you may be
 looking for shorts on this
 um four hour here and hopefully it can
 louder the weekly or might even look for
 some combo levels inside that maybe I'll
 even go to uh this hourly here might be
 a little bit better of an opportunity to
 get in if I'm going to do 100x on this
 this hourly was already hit so now need
 to look at that so maybe you even want
 to go 956 992. so I'd go something about
 like this I would go on this trade 84 22
 984. uh that looks pretty good to me
 um just like to front run the level a
 bit and uh yeah then we're looking to
 really get below this and close below
 this for the day so I kind of have like
 a little little plan about what I'm
 going to do next and you know I think
 I'm going to take a long up to that
 level so maybe I'll
 like to take along from here to there
 that's about three percent wow and then
 hopefully ride that down for another a
 pretty large move so maybe just maybe we
 can go back and uh
 see where this kind of trail of levels
 exists so what we'd be looking for we'd
 be looking to see what level it hit back
 here right so you kind of start right
 here and that hit that level there and
 that's a five minute level and then
 you've got this one right here
 has that been hit yet oh you're back
 down to that five minute level so the
 next level you'd be looking to Target
 here would be
 this
 that's already louder the move so that's
 gonna move to here which now moves to
 here which allowed to move which broke
 it down so now you actually have to be
 time frame up so you actually have to
 use and hold this and then that got
 tested there so yeah I think you'd be
 right at that 15 minute level something
 like this I think this is a okay spot I
 think it's a little risky it looks like
 the move is about to collapse but maybe
 even what you can do is you can use a
 pretty interior Trend here don't know if
 you have anything else you want to be
 using a 15 minute Trend here you want to
 use this one to that guy right there we
 can delete
 this one and just redraw that and and
 then you know what I'm doing right now
 is basically I'm just I'm just starting
 to look at those trade opportunities so
 that this is starting to look good
 you've got your your Trend you've got
 your whole double there and it's
 starting to look a good spot to buy just
 just as kind of like uh interim scalp
 anyways to get up to this level or once
 you hit this level if you hit this level
 first up here then obviously
 you know your better bet is going to be
 to write it down to that level that's a
 good good set of Trades so you know this
 is just a very quick
 look at a few things I would do on the
 charts I'm not going to go too crazy
 with getting into technical analysis
 right now we'll leave that for chapter
 six in this video but right now we're
 just talking about the like so I'm going
 to be doing stuff like this so we can
 kind of make my screen smaller here
 again and I'm going to be doing things
 like this on different charts different
 stocks across the markets
 um basically I'm looking for what the
 best opportunities are every single day
 it's 8 15 or almost 8 20 now in the in
 the morning and I'm just going to be
 doing this for the first 30 minutes or
 hour of my day and uh just kind of
 setting up some expectations for the
 next few hours of what I think could
 happen
 I might even look more more localized in
 this move I might even look right here
 to take a short we can just increase
 this Zoom again for a second so you guys
 can see I might even look right here to
 take a short I'm going to see how it
 reacts in a moment but I would like to
 mark this level and then
 um see if it can hold it for a few
 minutes and then if if it does it would
 be a great spot to say hey like this
 would be a nice little opportunity for
 another short here so I'm going to do
 this across all coins I'm going to do
 this across different stock markets uh
 Forex markets crypto markets I'm going
 to basically for the first hour of the
 day here until something really exciting
 happens I'm going to be just be charting
 different things and hoping to get into
 some positions I'm not going to force
 anything I'm not taking trades just to
 take them I'm only taking trades once
 they hit my levels I'm not coming into
 my office saying hey I have to take a
 trade I have to make money I have to do
 this no you want to take quality
 positions all day long
 or at least for your four or five or six
 hours if you find you haven't gotten any
 trades and it's been three hours you
 might need to just step away for a few
 minutes and then come back for another
 three hour session or if you come early
 early enough in the morning and you find
 the opportunities at the right time you
 might only work for half an hour so it
 kind of varies day to day so you have to
 keep that in mind and what it looks like
 and then so once I'm done my trading if
 it's a pretty easy day and I'm done say
 it's 8 15 now if I'm done by noon ish so
 if it's like a three hour kind of day if
 I'm done by noonish then what I'll do is
 I'll probably get an early workout in
 keep that balance what I'm not doing
 which I talked about already in this
 video setting alerts coming back to my
 charts to look at these things there is
 going to be the odd time where if I have
 a level like this guy here where I think
 this is a pretty decent level this blue
 one up here I think this is pretty good
 there's going to be the odd time where
 if it's 5 p.m at night and I notice this
 is happening because I just randomly
 checked my phone and price is kind of
 like around it's just hovering around
 here I might come back to my office for
 45 minutes and and see if I can get this
 trade and then if it executes just watch
 it for 15 minutes make sure it kind of
 gains the level than it needs to gain
 and then set a stop loss you know pretty
 pretty close to it so there are some
 circumstances where I will do that but
 but this is a pretty extenuating
 circumstance because you've got a weekly
 level that was just hit right here so
 that's what you're seeing this purple
 line it's a weekly level that Weekly
 level got hit and it's not very often
 you hit a weekly level like from this
 has happened if you were to wait for
 this level you would have would have
 been waiting since November
 um the first week in November so I mean
 this is this is a pretty good
 um not expectation this is a pretty good
 um exception to say okay well look
 it's okay for you know once every few
 months to be a little bit of a chart
 hound and be looking at this level after
 and right now like I said I would be
 analyzing this level to see if it can
 actually hold and uh if that one can't
 hold then it would start to look right
 here as well at uh at this level here so
 I'd be looking at these two levels again
 I wouldn't take a trade on this level
 yet I'd look and see if it's actually
 holding its move it's not it's kind of
 moving over it so I don't think I would
 be getting into this move rather I think
 I would be looking more towards
 um this right there or this one right
 here one of these two levels
 I'd probably just be looking more
 towards at this point I wouldn't even
 have taken that trade I'd be looking
 more towards this level up here this uh
 22 731 uh maybe I might even take 214
 just because it's a bit of a better
 trade I think you're going to get the
 benefit of both trades so regardless um
 we can just leave that and
 again going back to what the actual day
 looks like if I have finished my day
 earlier than expected so if I finish my
 day by noon at this point I'm really
 focusing on
 um just mental analysis and and getting
 my balance back I'll work out at that
 point and then I'll relax and get ready
 for the next day and that's you know the
 time after you're done trading that's
 really up to you but the beginning of
 your day in your day trading day you
 should have kind of a pretty good grasp
 on wake up pretty early
 trade for a few hours if you have found
 positions you can stop there and you
 know you make your money and you walk
 away you haven't found positions maybe
 take a break rebalance come for a second
 set so some days you might have
 part-time days where it's only two or
 three or four hours or maybe even just
 one hour and then other days you might
 be in front of your computer for eight
 hours nine hours ten hours if you can't
 find a position and you're like well
 dude I need to make money like I don't
 have a choice here then you're gonna
 have to put those hours in when the
 opportunities aren't there every single
 day all the time and the worst thing you
 can do is force these trades you just
 have to mark your levels and be patient
 and then you know if you're having
 trouble getting into positions try to
 open yourself up to also stock markets
 and different cryptocurrency coins all
 coins and and Forex markets Commodities
 Bitcoin so if you're finding it to be
 not enough then you can open yourself to
 other markets I personally feel like
 trading Bitcoin is just enough because
 the thing is so volatile there's always
 every couple minutes it goes by it kind
 of seems like there's a trade on the
 book so
 um that would be it for for this chapter
 I think that gives you a good
 um kind of roundabout look at what a day
 looks like and again this isn't meant to
 be what is my personal life look from
 morning till night this is just meant to
 be a snapshot of office hours and what I
 do and how I do it
 and the hours that you have to take and
 have to put in every day can vary so it
 could be two to three hours a day it
 could be sometimes 10 12 14 16 hours a
 day and then make sure that after you're
 done your work that every day you're
 rebalancing and just getting in that
 personal time and doing all the things
 you can't you can't be working all day
 you have to have set defined amount of
 hours and you've seen how clean and
 light and low impact my morning is is
 very much wake up get ready come to the
 office I trade I make money then I've
 earned the rest of that day and that's
 an important thing you've earned the
 rest of your free time that day you
 haven't earned that free time yet for
 the rest of the day
 take a break go back and trade just like
 take your 15 minute break get another
 coffee juice back up
 um take that time to just reset and then
 go back and trade and if you really
 don't make money that day because
 there's just no opportunities that's
 okay our our field is very fortunate
 that we can have days where we make ten
 thousand or fifty thousand dollars or
 even a thousand dollars a day and then
 if you have four or five bad days in a
 row it's like okay well you get good
 days and bad right and the good outweigh
 the bad and you have that buffer so uh
 that's it for this chapter quick little
 snapshot of what it looks like to work
 every single day as a day trader you
 should be doing this five six days a
 week if you want if you want to make not
 as much money but you value your free
 time or obviously you could work to one
 or two or three days a week but you kind
 of leave that up to each individual to
 make that decision so
 um on to the next chapter
 all right chapter five mental analysis
 okay this is a big one this is going to
 be an anchor or a linchpin or or just
 this huge kind of focus point of your
 career mental analysis is extremely
 important because every single day is a
 day trader and chapter five isn't gonna
 talk about
 um resources on mental analysis I did
 that in the previous chapters I believe
 it was chapter
 um two I did that on when we went into
 level two but mental analysis I want to
 talk about basically the way in which it
 can affect us and some some just high
 level Insight from somebody who's been
 doing this for a long time
 there is a very big big drain on on our
 emotional and psychological mind
 um
 it is crazy how often I see people with
 Suicidal Thoughts
 um with extreme highs and lows who
 develop anxiety who doubt themselves
 there's there's just a bunch of stuff I
 want to talk about when uh when it comes
 to mental analysis and being safe and
 taking care of yourself the first is
 that it's super important to have
 balance in your life before we get into
 mental analysis and some of the other
 the other cues here about what I what I
 want to talk about balance is a huge
 point that I need to discuss from zero
 as a day trader we have to be able to
 not get swallowed up into this world
 it's so easy to start day trading and it
 can become very addictive and it's very
 very fun to do and you can be making
 money and it's got a thrill to it it's
 got this ride factor it's got this you
 know you get a trade and there's a high
 that happens with it right because
 money's going up and you're winning your
 trades and you feel good it's like
 dopamine maxed out so so you know you
 have to really be able to control that
 because a Ken founder a lot of addictive
 personalities it can it can be very
 Danger address so this is like a really
 important thing to talk about and
 balance is a must in day trading so like
 earlier in this I talked about alerts
 from Trading view like I think that is a
 cardinal sin when you're thinking about
 alerts because it kind of Founders into
 the addictive mindset because then
 you're thinking about all day long
 you're like oh when's the next alert
 going to go off and you're constantly
 checking your charts and you're just
 always on your phone like you need to
 stay far away from this type of
 Lifestyle when it comes to day trading
 you can't be trading for four hours just
 to set alerts all day just to to leave
 to spend five minutes with your family
 and every 10 minutes you're checking
 price on your phone every 10 minutes
 every time I know it's hard to say this
 because you don't want to miss
 opportunities but trust me if somebody's
 been doing this for a long time and I've
 been through thousands of people and
 I've and I've had hundreds of hundreds
 of of people who've turned into seven
 figure Traders if not thousands by now
 or tens of thousands and I've you know
 the amount of exposure I've had to other
 day Traders
 is a lot I've worked with companies I've
 worked with people on individual level
 on a large influencer Creator level I've
 seen it all over the place the last
 thing you want to do
 yeah that's hard because it can become
 so addictive is just checking your phone
 all day picking it up looking at it
 checking price wow look at price now
 even if it's for two seconds swipe up
 face recognize go to it check price put
 it down that couple seconds becomes this
 really bad habit almost thinking of it
 like a smoker who always constantly
 needs to take a puff of their cigarette
 just like every 10 minutes they have to
 they can't live life without that
 puffing it's like getting in in the way
 of their life while I'm cooking hold on
 let me just walk away take a puff put it
 down like it's the same thing right like
 it's just people around you it might not
 affect you but it will affect your
 family it will affect your friends it
 will affect your social life you cannot
 be constantly checking your phone you
 have to be engaged with real life and
 not constantly focus on your charts and
 it's one of the reasons I don't like
 alerts and alarms I don't want to get a
 text message when I'm not trading when I
 have my four hours away to trade I want
 to take those four hours I want to
 maximize my time and I want to use the
 mental analysis courses to say here's my
 four hours how do I maximize it how
 through technical analysis and mental
 analysis which is chapter two how do I
 take that four hours and make the most
 of it so the rest of my day can be for
 me and my family and friends in Social
 and fixing my house and those things or
 watching TV shows right you don't want
 to be getting alarms all day long so
 this is something really important to
 talk about is balance when you are
 trading and charting leave it there
 leave it at the door trade chart and if
 you have a burn to do more
 Focus your mind for three or four hours
 after you're done trading on training
 and mental analysis on training on how
 to optimize your mind on getting better
 at technical analysis so your four hours
 of trading stays your four hours of
 trading and that's it so that's one of
 the things is like the addiction factor
 in living life that's really important
 in terms of mental analysis and having a
 stable Balanced Life another one is diet
 of course I'm going to give you the
 nutrition talk diet is important pick
 your diet your your pick your poison for
 diet don't want to get into a whole
 thing where I do recommendations you
 know your body you know your health
 the point is prioritize it get good
 sleep have a good diet live a clean
 productive optimized life and when you
 make money in trading put it towards
 things like paying bills Investments
 Financial Security in day trading
 sometimes we have bad years you want to
 be able to sit there and say hey I've
 got 100 or 200k sitting in the bank
 extra and so if I have a bad year like I
 can still support myself and I'm not
 going in the first time I make 25 Grand
 I'm gonna go spend 20 000 on it on a new
 TV because that's hype like yeah cool
 that's hype do that later get yourself
 stable for a few years first and then
 you can buy your toys and if you want to
 go buy super cars because you're making
 a million dollars a year so be it as
 long as you're responsible about it you
 want to spend 500 000 on a car make sure
 you have two or three million in the
 bank and your bills are paid and it's
 not like you have all these floating
 debts and you're living on credit cards
 and you you made a good day in trading
 and you decide to take that and go buy a
 Supercar with it because you had like
 some crazy trade you did and you made
 two or 300K in one day because that's
 really that's realistic and that's how
 it works right don't go on a you know
 even if you made 10 grand in a day and
 that's a big day for you don't take a
 thousand dollars and party like go go go
 get like a caesar salad at a place for
 like thirteen dollars get a nice Caesar
 salad tell your friends you want to go
 out have two drinks 25 on the town
 you're celebrating maybe even buy a
 round for the for the boys or the girls
 whatever and it's like okay I made 10
 grand don't go blow a thousand of it
 like just reasonable life expectations I
 shouldn't have to give this speech but I
 I do need to because in day trading
 there's a very cyclical thing where it's
 like we make tons of money so we want to
 spend lots of money no be responsible
 put that money in the bank save it
 invest it open up tax free savings
 account put it in gics government
 insured
 um cash bonds things like that just like
 be smart with your money so that's
 important to another mental analysis cue
 here is that I see a lot of people
 who um they can get suicidal over day
 trading they can doubt themselves a lot
 that's probably the number one thing you
 you see people where they go through
 like the value of disappointment and um
 you know you guys can look up valid
 disappointment and talk about it my
 courses are not going to get into that
 but you they go through the valley of
 disappointment and and they they're
 studying for three months four months
 and everything feels so good and they're
 progressing and progressing and then
 they go through a funk so month five six
 seven it's like it feels like they're
 getting worse they've learned too much
 it's information overload performance is
 going down you get into a lot of these
 super high and super low cues and day
 trading as constant roller coaster
 it's like no matter what you're doing
 day trading is a roller coaster so you
 have to be aware of that you have to be
 aware that I am going to go through
 times where I feel like I'm progressing
 really good and be mindful that in a few
 weeks I might feel really bad because
 I've made a lot of bad decisions and I
 feel like I'm not learning and
 everything is not making sense you have
 to have a community to support you
 that's where Community is so important
 like we talked about community in
 chapter one this is going to come back
 to chapter one where Community is so
 important so you can say guys I'm having
 a down day what do you do just friends
 to talk to maybe you don't trade maybe
 your trading date isn't actually trading
 but it's just getting through some of
 these funks and talking to other people
 inside your community reaching out to me
 in Discord and saying cotton man like
 dude I'm having a tough day like I just
 everything's wrong I've had a bad couple
 weeks I can't pay my bills like I'm
 really frustrated and stressed out what
 can I do and if I can't answer you
 because I get literally 100 two through
 400 messages a day and I rarely get to
 answer maybe one of the coaches can help
 or maybe you can join one of the higher
 tiers on patreon and just ask them and
 talk to them and go into a mentorship
 program with us or like there's there's
 ways you can just talk to the community
 in an open platform you can message me
 you can message the coaches you can go
 into like mentorship like I said or or
 the higher tiers and talk to those
 people like there's there's ways don't
 deal with it on your own it's uh it's
 really important to understand that you
 know there are people here to help you
 and listen and sometimes it's just as
 much as as a good shoulder to cry on or
 someone to listen to and we're here for
 you we're here for that as a community
 we'll help you through it and uh don't
 give up because there's a lot of highs
 and lows
 um inside of day trading I see it all
 the time so you know mental analysis is
 this very
 crazy balance between keeping yourself
 aligned and having realistic
 expectations and creating a healthy life
 because you're Your Own Boss in this
 field so there's no one to keep you in
 check so you have to create those
 healthy cues you have to create that
 Progressive lifestyle you have to be
 able to sit there and say like look I
 have the systems I need I have Financial
 money in the bank for when there's rainy
 days and I have a community of friends
 who are there to pick me up when I'm
 just feeling bad so that's like some of
 the biggest stuff that I see
 and um yeah it's it's really like a high
 and low type of field so you have to do
 your best to kind of stay in the middle
 not get too crazy high when things are
 high and also don't fall too hard when
 things are low kind of just sway in
 between a little bit and when you go
 down use Community to help and when or
 or money that you've left in the bank
 have those buffers and then when you go
 high don't go and over indulge which
 which would risk the bottom side right
 like staying right in that middle point
 because like I said I get tons of people
 come to me and they just go through
 these funks and it's really important to
 be mindful about them so mental analysis
 as a whole is about living a better life
 and there's not a lot of do this types
 of tips more this is me giving you guys
 information guys and gals giving you
 information and advice from someone
 who's been doing this for a long time
 and how I would navigate and guide
 myself so hopefully that helps chapter
 five and uh let's move on to the next
 okay here we are chapter six chapter six
 I want to do a little differently than I
 originally thought I want to go over
 some examples and kind of quick
 strategies on how to trade just as a
 quick look at um originally this was
 supposed to be what does the career look
 like uh and what what does the
 day-to-day look like so I wanna I wanna
 change up what I originally thought I
 was going to do which was going to be
 kind of IRL footage walking around I'm
 gonna make a different video for that in
 this video I kind of want to just take
 some trades or just show how I trade
 um a little bit just some quick
 strategies so people have an idea of
 what the career looks like from an
 actual technical standpoint and um then
 we can get to it so we've gone through a
 lot of content in this guide we've gone
 through how to use a community in day
 trading and why it's so important why we
 learn ta how to learn it software's and
 exchanges we use
 um examples of what the day looks like
 so we did the office walk through and
 all that mental analysis and how
 important that is and now just living
 each day day to day so I didn't want to
 make this guide just focused on
 technical analysis because you can't
 learn technical analysis from one guide
 all I can do is show you the resources
 where you can learn which are my
 resources and then say look you've got a
 long road ahead of you let's be
 realistic here and uh let's actually get
 some proper work done so now what we're
 going to do is we're going to take a
 look at um some trading so so what I'm
 going to do here is I'm just going to
 take my camera make it a bit smaller and
 I'm going to show you what it looks like
 so you're in your office and you're
 about to day trade and this is kind of
 the stuff you're going to be doing every
 single day so if I had a blank chart I'm
 just going to remove all drawings what I
 need to do what the first part of my job
 to do is to understand where whatever
 I'm trading today we're using Bitcoin
 where Bitcoin is doing and what it's
 been doing so I use color codes for
 everything it helps me visually
 communicate
 um the different the different time
 frames that I've marked this on so if
 I'm you know somewhere on say like uh I
 don't know a one hour time frame I have
 a green line well green for me is
 supposed to be 15 so if I'm if I'm on
 the one hour time frame I can say oh
 look here's a green line it means I
 marked this on a 15 minute chart so we
 need to color code things so the first
 thing I'm going to do every day when I
 walk in to do day trainings I'm just
 going to kind of set out some ground
 expectations these are weekly time
 frames so we want to change the weekly
 color which I use purple for so we've
 got some weekly time frames here that we
 have and uh now we need to go and kind
 of say what are the opportunities on the
 day so we've got weekly time frames
 we've got daily daily would be red we
 don't really need anything marked here
 on the dailies maybe this one as a daily
 might be nice so what I'm doing right
 now is I'm marking the bodies of candles
 as what I call hold levels so my job
 here is to start marking out by colors
 and by different
 um areas on the chart my job is to start
 to understand where this thing can go
 next so every day this is what I'm doing
 and I have to kind of use my best
 judgment and my uh my best ability here
 as a Trader to do this so I need to
 start up here and say okay well this
 four hour is tested there so I need to
 move on to this one here and so that's
 tested right there so I need to move on
 to this next one here and that one was
 tested there so now I need to go right
 here and this looks like kind of the
 final Target for Bitcoin right now so I
 would kind of try to set my first trade
 in and around this area and I know now
 on my screen that I've got a red line
 here that's a daily level that was
 marked the yellow is a four hour and
 this purple is a weekly and you can see
 this weekly had been getting hit here
 and ultimately had had fell and
 collapsed down much lower in the uh in
 the charts here and then we followed
 that trail of levels all the way from
 the top to here so I've kind of got like
 my first good expectation a really nice
 short so for example if I was to take
 this trade here short this down to this
 level here which is what I think I'll do
 I'll use if I'm going to use a thousand
 dollars of Leverage and I'm doing this
 on 100x that would be an 8 000 profit if
 I'm using
 um 2500 that would be a 25 uh twenty
 thousand dollar profit it typically I'll
 use more like five or ten thousand
 dollars on Leverage so at five thousand
 dollars this would be a forty thousand
 dollar profit on uh ten thousand dollars
 of Leverage this would be an eighty
 thousand dollar profit so that's kind of
 just like kind of what I would expect to
 make based on how much money I'm willing
 to put on this trade and then I would
 gauge how much money I'm putting on this
 trade based on how much I like this
 position I wanted to take the trade but
 I thought it was a subpar level because
 it was like well it might hit this but
 it might go deeper into like say like a
 one hour level up here maybe it's gonna
 go all the way up here to this one hour
 level
 you know Mark that as blue so I know
 it's a one hour level maybe it's gonna
 go all the way up here to this one hour
 level or uh even right here or maybe up
 here like there's different spots this
 thing could go so let's just mark it
 here for example if it's going to go up
 here and there's a high chance that it's
 going to go up there because I think
 that I may use a smaller amount of money
 on this yellow level instead of using
 ten thousand dollars I may just use one
 thousand dollars and then I might use
 2500 on this and then as it goes deeper
 and deeper into the levels I might scale
 up or if I really love this this four
 hour level here this the Seattle level
 then I would use that and I would say
 okay well that's great let's use a big
 amount of margin on this level and hope
 to hopefully you can make 80 grand and
 then that way I don't have to work for
 the rest of the month so you can't get
 into scenarios in this but this is very
 far in your career but this is a maybe
 good motivation for people or or
 something where you can say hey maybe
 after three or four years of studying
 and practicing this is the level I can
 get to where I can make eighty thousand
 dollars on one trade in a month and
 that's realistic for day Traders but
 some people stop there and they don't
 work for three weeks and some people
 this happens over the course of two days
 and then the next two days they're back
 at it they do it again so so what I'm
 doing here is I'm starting to Mark out
 different levels so I want to start from
 highest time frame down so you notice we
 started with the weekly we Mark the
 daily we Mark the four hour level here
 uh actually I think this was a one hour
 level I think we might have made a
 mistake on that one so this is actually
 a one hour level we need to readjust
 this to a one-hour level that was
 actually incorrect by me so here's a one
 hour level the four hour level would
 actually be right here so let's move
 that I think I just clicked the wrong
 time frame earlier in the video so four
 hour level one hour level nah this one
 hour level is actually making a lot more
 sense now I wouldn't go after this four
 hour level this one hour level makes a
 lot of sense so we've got the one hour
 level next I'm gonna go down to the 15
 minute level I kind of want to just see
 if there's any untested levels here so
 let's mark this green before we start
 right and so this is just what I'm going
 to do every single day and uh kind of a
 strategy that I would employ people to
 use so this is hit right there so then
 we're going to go to the next level and
 in this specific video we're using these
 are what's called hold levels and
 reverse levels is what I'm using so
 you'll learn about that in level five
 and six of my courses so this was hit
 and then we got to go to this next one
 which would be the body of this next
 candle right here
 which would be that one hit there and we
 have a back side here which would also
 be a combination level so there's
 nothing there so so I might want to look
 inside of here so what about this as an
 origin level it could become an origin
 level in the future but I'm not too
 concerned about that the only other
 thing I might want to do is come inside
 of here and say okay is this level
 tested you use the Wicker the body
 either or is tested that is tested so we
 can't use that this one up here is
 tested which leads you to the next one
 right here you kind of follow the trail
 of your eyes right or you know if this
 level is tested here what's the next
 closest level on the chart it would be
 here if it was in this Candlestick here
 it would just be the next level to be
 tested the highest price in this point
 so you know if you beat the choice
 between this two candles right here and
 this one right here well this one's
 higher in price which is a greedier
 Target which is what we would use so now
 we kind of have a few different levels
 here and we've got to color code this to
 the five minute level so that when we go
 back to our larger picture view here
 where we can see kind of everything
 happening we can just look at this and
 we can be like okay what do these lines
 mean
 okay well that's a five minute level
 that's an hourly level because the color
 that's a four hour and this is a daily
 right so now we have like a very clear
 explanation and a quite quite a very
 easy to understand expansion of these
 levels this is like a nice strategy that
 I like to use I like to kind of Mark the
 highest time frame levels down and this
 is a good strategy for for newer traders
 to do to start testing their abilities
 as a Trader you start with the highest
 time frames down Mark the bodies and
 Wicks whichever one is tested and maybe
 we should write kind of like a rule set
 here for people so go like this
 um number one start highest time frame
 start with uh highest time frame and
 move down one
 time frame at a time it's not really
 great English I'm sure we could gravity
 that but that's okay for now and let's
 make this maybe uh just a really nice
 and small text so people can see it on
 the screen
 um you know the number one thing we do
 uh maybe let's make it a little bit
 bigger number one thing we do is start
 with the highest time frame down so
 that's what you just saw me do there
 number two thing is we Mark old levels
 do minor cold levels Quicks or
 bodies
 the wick is going to be the first test
 of it the body is the greedier point of
 that and and what I would say in regards
 to that is if you mark the wick of a
 candle you're marking the entire range
 of the level so the level range which
 you can learn about ranges in my corset
 but the level range exists from the wick
 all the way to the body and then inside
 the body is the smaller ranges so for
 example if this yellow piece right here
 this Wick of this candle was the entire
 range of this all the way up to here
 right that's the range of that four hour
 candle the testing of the body of this
 candle would mean that you're testing
 the greedier part of the four hour and
 the higher part of the next range that's
 the way it works so then if you were to
 go to the one hour which would be the
 next time frame down then we can say oh
 here's the range of that hourly would be
 all the way from here to here so if you
 said we're testing the hourly level
 technically you would go into this four
 hour and you would test the wick of that
 one hour and that would stop the move
 right there or if you think it's going
 to go to a 5 or a 15 or something lower
 you would go to the body of the hourly
 and you'd start to move down into those
 time frames so this body of this hourly
 is actually the same thing as that 15
 but there's no difference there because
 it's the same candle as you can see the
 body of the hourly the same as the body
 of the 15 but if we go into the five now
 we have all the way from
 this right here which is technically
 tested but after seeing all those
 reverse levels that we did see in the
 past chart there we can say that it's
 probably going after this here so I
 would use a larger amount of Leverage on
 this level and so when you're looking at
 these time frames down and you're kind
 of doing this we Mark whole levels Wicks
 or bodies now you know why we Mark whole
 levels Wicks our bodies start with the
 wick
 but understand the body is the greediest
 uh greediest point of that time frame
 that meaning that specific time frame
 right so that meaning that time frame as
 the four hour that's the greediest part
 of the four hour now the greediest part
 of the entire range because remember
 this range exists from this yellow line
 right here all the way to actually the
 top of this right here four to four but
 then we wouldn't take a trade on that
 level we would take a trade on the
 greediest part inside the range which
 would be this five minute level here at
 23041 so that's kind of the first two
 things we do a good like starting
 strategy for when you're looking to take
 trades and when you're looking to
 actually get these positions that's how
 you do it and then what we need to do
 next is start to Mark Trends so again we
 want to start from the highest time
 frame so we've already made a mistake
 here I started on the four hour I'm just
 going to delete this I'm going to go to
 the weekly we're not going to have a
 weekly Trend here we we will actually
 from this to this here and we're always
 using accumulation to accumulation on
 the top side and distribution to
 Distribution on the bottom side so we
 got accumulation there we want to go
 over to the Daily levels and then we can
 Mark uh
 ulterior Trend right here which is going
 to be red we're doing the same thing but
 with Trends now right now we're going to
 go to the four hour and you can see how
 this trend has been respected pretty
 um pretty through and through on this
 trade right like you can see that trend
 is actually getting respected very well
 in this case I want to Mark a secondary
 Trend which is this candle here to this
 right here which would be your first
 four hour Trend now you're going to
 learn about Trends and why I'm marking
 this one in the future uh lesson but
 then I'm going to mark it to there and
 I'm going to delete this daily because I
 want to take the greedy you're trying to
 this is almost like the same thing we
 just did with those levels and saying
 there's a range inside the levels well
 there's a range inside your Trends as
 well so now instead of saying hey I want
 to buy this part of the four hour or
 this body of the four hour I want to go
 into the one hour hold level like let's
 Zoom this in instead of buying let's get
 rid of that instead of buying this part
 of the four hour level maybe I want to
 Target the one hour level and inside
 that I think we can go all the way to
 the five so you'd be doing the same
 thing with these Trends by saying this
 yellow one here is equal to this red one
 here so so if if this four hour here
 were the first part of the range this
 red one here would be that first part of
 the ring so I'm just going to delete
 that because I don't I don't need it I'm
 not taking a trade there and now I can
 say okay I've got a pretty good Trend
 um look at how well this thing has been
 respected from here to here right from
 that accumulation to accumulation candle
 the trend held here it got a second spot
 here that it held down and it's going to
 move here so now I've got a very
 interesting kind of multiplier modifier
 not a multiplier maybe we'll consider
 this a modifier on the chart now if we
 were to go straight up today and get a
 pretty big rip I think it would be wise
 to take this level because it's close
 enough to the trend that you can do
 something like this where you deep dive
 the trend and then you come back and
 reject the move so you go a little bit
 over the trend you never hard close a
 trend but then you reject the move
 therefore holding this trend back in the
 future right and then you can maybe come
 up like this and do the same thing here
 and then here and if you were to Target
 at this point that that's where that
 Trend would break when you're too far
 over top of that Trend but this is like
 a really nice way to take that trade so
 if this thing were to start moving up
 really fast today I think I like this
 level even more because it has a great
 Confluence with
 um being a five minute hold level that
 can support Trends still but if we were
 going to sit here and go like this and
 come back up and go down like this and
 we're kind of hitting this trend at this
 point I would probably just stick to
 this hourly level right here
 um anything higher than that I would be
 worried about hitting this five minute
 coming holding this trend and then
 starting to move up and Ladder because
 this little time section right here
 where you start laddering over top of
 Trent that's going to hard close it on
 those bigger time frames like that for
 hour now we're getting a little far
 ahead of ourselves in terms of technical
 analysis for like a comprehensive guide
 beginners course but this kind of
 creates the queue of events to show you
 why we need to Mark hole levels and why
 we need to Mark Trends so now I can sit
 here and say okay based on what time of
 the day this hits whether it's here or
 whether it's out here whenever this
 trend is breaking I need to know the
 levels that are close to that that can
 say hey this is a little bit over top a
 trend we can hit that level and still
 move down if we were all the way out
 here for example there's no way you're
 going to hit this trend move up to this
 level and be like oh we just hit that
 level let's close Trend now no because
 by the time it starts to sync this is
 actually going to create a hard close on
 that time frame so you're going to have
 a candle opening over top of that trend
 on an hourly or four hour time frame so
 that's kind of our next step in what we
 need to do is to number three is to Mark
 our Trends and
 see the relationship
 between them and the levels
 nearby uh it's a little bit of choppy
 English but that that's I think
 everybody gets it we don't need to do
 that
 um so this is like a really nice
 strategy to really kind of refine your
 technical analysis in a nice way where
 you can say like here I got levels I got
 Trends these are going to be smart buy
 spots where you can take some of those
 and then number four is you monitor your
 trade and and number four the fourth
 thing you would do now is once you're in
 that trade because you've done all your
 your uh whole level work or your levels
 work and your Trends work and by the way
 that's all we use as levels and Trends
 once you've done all that work now you
 can just say
 it's time to monitor at trade so if you
 remember back to chapter two I believe
 it was we talked about the three lanes
 of day trading so what we did just now
 is a lot of PA procedural analysis
 everything that can happen before the
 trade so we did a lot of PA here that's
 remember there's three lanes in training
 the first Lane which is everything
 before the trade what's happening during
 the trade which is when we are going to
 be hitting these levels and Trends and
 then what happens after the trade so
 we've covered by marking out all of our
 levels all of our Trends
 um the expectations we have we've
 covered that procedural analysis there
 we've covered the first Lane of trading
 on the day so Lane won the first Lane of
 trading is done the next part of trading
 is what we would do is we would monitor
 the trade as it's happening so if we
 have our order set say right here and
 this thing starts moving up like crazy
 I'm just going to give out two different
 scenarios maybe you get to this trend
 you hit this trend you go right up here
 you hit your trade it starts to pull
 back now you're in lane two so now
 you've got your trade it's in a slightly
 like a little bit of profits you've
 you've selected a good Target something
 that's smart that makes sense
 trade starts to pull back you're now in
 your second lane which is comparative
 analysis so now what we need to do is we
 need to compare the events of what's
 happening so that's where we're going to
 go through a couple different little
 scenarios here so what's going to happen
 here is you've entered your trade great
 now one of two things can happen number
 one it starts to fall down and uh you
 you have kind of this slow drop like
 this at this point I would say uh oh if
 we stay above this trend for too long if
 we're here for like an hour two hours
 guess what if we were to go over to this
 four hour time frame eventually if we
 keep staying over top of this trend
 you're gonna have a four hour candle
 hard close here and it's the bottom of
 that candle that you care about hard
 closing it doesn't matter if the candle
 is halfway between like this this is not
 a hard close this entire candle the
 bottom side of the body needs to be over
 the entire Trend so that's a hard close
 that's a hard close that looks like a
 hard close
 that is not a hard close you see where
 you just get that little tiny corner of
 it over even that is not a hard close
 that is a hard close such a small
 precise minute thing but a critical
 difference in why accuracy is so
 important in in our uh in what we do so
 now you're gonna have a couple different
 outcomes like I said and the first
 outcome here is comparatively we need to
 compare where our Target hit and we took
 our trade versus the events that are
 happening so if this were happening like
 like I showed you and you're holding
 over top of that Trend I would say oh
 okay I need to get out of this trade and
 lock up my profits it's only 40 percent
 that's fine this thing's about to rip up
 I need to get out of this and maybe even
 consider switching my position into a
 long so I need to take my short position
 that was right here I shorted this and I
 need to
 um go here and I need to exit that short
 position as this is holding and I need
 to open up a new long to take this next
 level up to there and then I can make my
 percentages there so that's the scenario
 one where we're inside of lane two of
 the trade and we are um actually going
 and saying how do we manage this trade
 the next scenario that could happen in
 this rate as this thing starts sinking
 like this and you kind of get to this
 trend and you're starting to fall
 underneath it and you're going to like
 this and this would maybe be a whole
 level that you would use like you might
 want to go and do something like this
 right here this is a whole level if
 you're getting underneath this trend but
 this whole level is holding that's fine
 you want to stay in this trade you want
 to stay in this trade to see if that can
 collapse because it might come up here
 again like this and then it might break
 straight down and then you're in a sick
 trade right or it might just go straight
 below but really this trend is kind of
 the controller of this trade so in the
 first scenario it's closing over Trend
 and we need to get out of the trade and
 kind of flip our positions in the second
 scenario it's actually losing its Trend
 so it's it's like these candles here or
 it went up it tried to break and it fell
 down it went up it tried to break and it
 fell down it's it's that scenario and
 you're going to have a huge trade on
 your hands where you're going to be
 making you know if you're using 100x
 leverage like I do then you're going to
 be making you know 200 300 percent four
 or five eight hundred percent so now
 that's this thing it's time to monitor
 that trade and I'm gonna put
 narrative
 oh no we did the cap lock error okay
 that's right that's fine that's fine
 reset um
 comparative analysis oh God now I can't
 spell
 so now we need to do that comparative
 analysis so that's how you would manage
 that trade and then the third lane of
 that trade just is your or that's risk
 assessment I should say that turns into
 comparative analysis because you're
 assessing the risk and
 um also moving into comparative analysis
 and then you start over on the bottom so
 that should give you like a really good
 grasp on okay here's how you manage the
 trade this is what you do during the
 trade and this is what it looks like
 every single day so we Mark out our
 expectations we're in this trade and uh
 we need to compare that to those events
 right so now we can delete this we can
 delete that go back to our four hour
 make sure we just have a few levels and
 Trends and now we we have things that we
 are supposed to do and we know what
 exactly to do now once these levels get
 hit right and then the cycle starts over
 again so this is kind of like a really
 nice one two three four strategy
 that's easy to adopt for any new or
 older Trader who's been doing this for a
 long time or who's just starting this is
 a really easy to adopt strategy that
 allows you to understand
 this is the way it should look every
 time we trade we Mark our levels we Mark
 our Trends and then we do our analysis
 now I did a very pulled back uh stripped
 down version of analysis I'm not going
 into all the different things that I go
 into you can learn those in my courses
 and then you can add that to your
 toolkit where you're doing even more
 crazy analysis and that's fine but for
 the purpose of this video it's just like
 a nice quick strategy for people to say
 oh this is like a nice
 um kind of one two three four routine to
 get into and then you can add on top of
 it as you get better and better and
 better remember never indicators never
 any of that stuff and this is like a
 really great way to just have have a
 nice well-rounded strategy it's not the
 ultimate strategy but it's a nice
 well-rounded way to look at the charts I
 think it's well-rounded kind of this is
 what I need to do every time I day trade
 so I hope that helps and uh I think I
 think that's kind of it for chapter six
 here let me just take a look at my list
 make sure there's nothing else
 um living each day for chapter six day
 to day this is what we do every single
 day day to day you do your charts just
 like I did up here
 um this is what we do every day and then
 we already he talked about earlier in
 the videos in chapter four kind of what
 it looks like afterwards so I've done
 this for a few hours and I'll touch back
 on that a little bit I've done this for
 a few hours now I've made my money times
 take a break reset enjoy my day
 um have a great dinner have a great
 lunch be healthy feel good maybe do some
 shopping I don't know maybe I want to
 Repair sunglasses I like my sunglasses
 whatever whatever your fanciest you go
 do your thing you get your sunglasses do
 whatever you want man and and then it's
 like enjoy your day go to sleep wake up
 rested rinse repeat every day and I hope

 good we're done got that out of the way
 and in the very
 um bottom of this video in the
 description you're gonna see a ton of
 resources so I will put dozens and
 dozens of links everything from what
 exchange to use
 to where the courses are to links to the
 trading journal that we talked about
 earlier in this video every resource I
 can think of this is just going to act
 as one big dump file for those resources
 so make sure you check out the section
 put in the comments what you liked about
